  |     Summary                                                             |

  |   Here, order is maintained by the Church of Seiros, which hosts the    |
  |   prestigious Officer's Academy within its headquarters. You are        |
  |   invited to teach one of its three mighty houses, each comprised of    |
  |   students brimming with personality and represented by a royal from    |
  |   one of three territories. As their professor, you must lead your      |
  |   students in their academic lives and in turn-based, tactical RPG      |
  |   battles wrought with strategic, new twists to overcome. Which         |
  |   house, and which path, will you choose?                               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The game features the refined gameplay the Fire Emblem franchise is   |
  |   known for. Command a party of warriors to move and fight on a         |
  |   grid-based battlefield and, for the first time in the series          |
  |   history, assign battalions of troops to support individual units in   |
  |   battle. As a professor, you are responsible for teaching your         |
  |   students and improving their skills in their academic lives and in    |
  |   battle. These may be school assignments, but the stakes are very      |
  |   real. Your students' lives depend on your leadership. It's up to      |
  |   you to guide each of them, so that they may wield a variety of        |
  |   weapons, master the study of magic, and acquire special skills such   |
  |   as horsemanship. But there's more to being a professor than           |
  |   commanding armies. Freely roam Garreg Mach Monastery and the          |
  |   academy within it, while interacting with talented students to        |
  |   build relationships and gather intel. After meeting one enigmatic     |
  |   girl named Sothis...you'll come to realize that she appears only      |
  |   within your mind. What other mysteries await?                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * The Officer's Academy is home to three houses: The Black Eagles,    |
  |     The Blue Lions, and The Golden Deer... Which house will you         |

  |                                                                         |
